### Tip of the Icerberg
My name is Angely C. Suarez DeJesus, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Text & Technology doctoral program at the University of Central Florida. My interests are within the areas of rhetoric and composition. It entails the exploration of the ways in which Generative AI algorithms managed by content moderators in large language models affect Latino women and other BIPOC groups through textual rhetoric.
